Input Array = {31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58}

Working for the Loop Invariants

j = 1, key = 41, i = 0 and inner loop breaks, 41 is written at index 1

j = 2, key = 59, i = 1 and inner loop breaks, 59 is written at index 2

j = 3, key = 26, i = 2 59 is written at index 3 and i = 1
{31, 41, 59, 59, 41, 58}
i = 1, 41 is written at index 2, 
i = 0, 31 is written at index 1, i = -1 inner loop breaks
26 is written at index 0
{26, 31, 41, 59, 41, 58}
j = 4, key = 41, i = 3, 59 is written at index 4, 
i = 2, inner loop breaks, 41 is written at index 3
{26, 31, 41, 41, 59, 58}

j = 5, key = 58, i = 4, 59 is written at index 5
i = 3, inner loop breaks
58 is written at index 4

{26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59}
